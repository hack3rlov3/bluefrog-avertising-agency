Final eProject semester 4 HDSE(Hue-Aptech)

Name of eProject: Advertising Agency

EProject description:
The Advertising Agency Department people generally maintain the details of the
advertisements through the paper work, because of which several discrepancies take
place  like missing of  the  information, data mismatch due  to  the mixing up of data,
etc. Due to the occurrence of these discrepancies, they are losing the orders and attention  of  the  customers.  For  placing  the  order  the  customer must  come  to  the Office  or  need  to  send  through  the  post  along  with  the  money  order.  Once  the advertisement and the payment for the advertisement is received the advertisement
will  be  approved  and  will  be  advertised  as  per  the  customer  specifications  and
requirements.
